This gem is intended to provide a clean Ruby 1.9 interface to Silverpop's mailing APIs for

    1. Managing a mailing list in Silverpop - users and all of their properties.
    2. Making requests to the Silverpop Engage API to pull reports.


==========================================================================================


Basic startup usage looks like this:

    # Set the log location
    SilverpopClient.logger = Reports::ReportAuditLogger.new(some_log_location)

    # Set the log level
    SilverpopClient.logger.level = Logger::INFO

    # Set the list id
    SilverpopClient.silverpop_list_id = some_list_id

    # Instantiate client
    @client = SilverpopClient::Client.new(:account_name => "some_account_name")


==========================================================================================

Run all specs with

$ bundle exec rake test
